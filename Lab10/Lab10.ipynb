    "**IQR, or Interquartile Range**, is a measure of statistical dispersion and is a key concept in identifying outliers in a dataset. It's the difference between the 75th percentile (Q3) and the 25th percentile (Q1) of a dataset. Here's a more detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quartiles:** Data is divided into quartiles:\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Q1 (25th percentile):** The median of the first half of the dataset. 25% of the data points are less than or equal to Q1.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   **Q2 (50th percentile or median):** The middle value of the dataset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   **Q3 (75th percentile):** The median of the second half of the dataset. 75% of the data points are less than or equal to Q3.\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Interquartile Range (IQR)**: It is calculated as IQR = Q3 - Q1. This range covers the middle 50% of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use in Outlier Detection:** IQR is often used to find outliers in data. Outliers are usually considered to be any data points that fall below Q1 - 1.5 * IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 * IQR. This rule of thumb is effective in practice for many datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of IQR:** Unlike range or standard deviation, IQR is not affected by extremes and is therefore a more robust measure of the spread of data, especially useful in datasets with outliers or non-normal distribution."

    "### Validating clustering\n",
    "Validating clustering results, especially for unsupervised learning methods like K-Means, can be challenging because, unlike supervised learning, you don't have labeled data to test against. However, there are several methods you can use to assess the quality and validity of your clusters:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Elbow Method:** This is useful for determining the optimal number of clusters. You've already done this if you've plotted the sum of squared distances (inertia) for different \n",
    "k\n",
    "k values and looked for an 'elbow' in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Silhouette Score:** This measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. The silhouette score ranges from -1 to +1, where a high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters. If the majority of your objects have a high value, the clustering configuration is good.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cluster Validation Indices:** There are various indices like Davies-Bouldin index or Dunn index that can be used to validate clusters. A lower Davies-Bouldin index relates to a model with better separation between the clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual Inspection:** This is subjective but can be useful. Plotting the clusters and examining their spread and separation can provide insights into their validity. For example, using scatter plots as you did.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compare Against Known Benchmarks:** If any known benchmarks or labeled datasets are similar to your data, you can use them to validate your clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stability:** If you re-run your clustering multiple times with different subsets of the data and the clusters remain consistent, this can be a sign of good clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Domain Knowledge:** Sometimes, consulting with domain experts and interpreting the clusters in the context of subject-matter expertise can validate whether the clusters make sense logically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consistency Across Different Methods:** If multiple clustering methods (like hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, etc.) yield similar results, it increases the confidence in your clusters."
